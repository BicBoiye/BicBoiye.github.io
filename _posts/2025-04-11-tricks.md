# These are some things I learned using markdown
I have used a simplified version of markdown in the past using the discord chatting platform. It supports a very limited version of markdown so I only know the basics like titles, **bold** text, *italics*. Also in the past, I've used HTML to format webpages with a CSS style sheet. 

## Image formatting
As you have seen in the index page, I have included an image of Tinkerbell. This image is 4284x5712 pixels which is absolutely massive and wraps around and ended up underneath the original image. Markdown doesn't have a dedicated resizing feature so I used an HTML tag for images which allows me to resize:

![tinkerbell.png](/images/tinkerbell.png)
Now small
<img src="/images/tinkerbell.png" width="200">
