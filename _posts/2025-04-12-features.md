## Using confusion matrices, t-SNE and sklearn to evaluate my model
Just wrapped up a major milestone in the fastai course — building an image classifier that distinguishes between airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and dogs! 🚀🐱🐦

✅ Used a DataBlock to preprocess and organize data

✅ Trained a CNN with transfer learning

✅ Evaluated results using a confusion matrix

✅ Visualized feature space using t-SNE to understand how my model is grouping images under the hood

Here’s a quick look at the t-SNE plot — amazing to see how images of similar classes naturally cluster together in feature space.

It is very hard to evaluate in 3D space though
